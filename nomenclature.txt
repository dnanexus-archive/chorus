This file describes how to name cohorts in a systematic matter

Some abbreviations:
-----------

CTR = control

Ethnicities:
MAL = Malay
IND = Indian
CHN = Chinese

First group of letters will have disease, control, project  name. If the cohort is the control,it
starts with CTR for control.   This is so when sorted alphabetically, the CTR's cluster
together by the eye.
Examples: T2D for type 2 diabetes, or CTR.T2D if  control group for type II diabetes. If it's a project name,
like CTR.PRISM (controls for PRISM)


Second group of letters will be the ancestry, if known.

By this definition, TTSH's dataset would be:
RA_         (I don't think we know if the RA patients are Chinese, we could check.)
CTR.RA_CHN

PRISM would be:
CTR.PRISM_

NUHS would be 
CTR.T2D_CHN
CTR.T2D_IND
T2D_CHN
T2D_IND

YY's datasets would be:
CTR.SSMP_MAL
CTR.SGVP_
CTR.SSIP_IND
